<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="nnw9Uw">Sasha, who is almost 32, is one of YouTube’s most-known success stories and arguably one of the most popular and recognizable beauty gurus on the platform, with almost 10 million subscribers and well over a billion views of her videos. <br><br>“I was waking up feeling so lost. I didn’t know why.”</p>
<p id="apfnb2">Blanco, who is successful in her field, if not at the very top of it. At the beginning of 2016, she landed on the covers of Vogue and Nylon, lauded for her success both online and off. She should have been damn pleased with herself at that point. But that’s not how she felt.</p>
<p id="t7YAjJ">“I peaced out because I think I was going through depression. I don’t know because I didn’t go to a hospital or anything or get diagnosed, but I was taking a few quizzes online and I felt really sad every day,” Banco says. Of her dual covers, she muses: “You would think, You should be happy. <em>But I wasn’t. I was waking up </em>feeling so broken. I didn’t know why.”</p>
<p>After speaking to Bianco for an hour, I noticed her palpable sense of relief about the decision to move behind the scenes and away from being in front of the camera. She won’t miss the commenter trolls either, one of whom wrote terrible things on her videos, then showed up at an event bearing a teddy bear for her. Even her mom and extended family get recognized now.</p>

<p><span>We all know the transformative powers of a swipe of blush, so let's explore the role of cheek makeup a little more deeply, how to choose the best type of cheek makeup for your complexion, and the best makeup brush for the job.  </span></p>
<p><span>A former developer for a Japanese cosmetic brand and makeup specialist, provides her professional guidance.</span></p>
<h3>1. Create a vivid, lively appearance</h3>
<p>Applying cheek as a final touch to your makeup add extra warmth to your face, if you like to go for cooler overall touch, use a darker shade of cheek.</p>
<h3>2. Give your face more depth</h3>
<p>Applying foundation does make your skin look smoother, but it can also make your face flat, or bigger because of the whiteness of the foundation. Adding an extra layer of color create a depth to your face and makes it look smaller in appearance.</p>
<h3>3. Change the overall image with the smallest effort</h3>
<p>Are you wearing the same makeup, no matter what clothes you wear? Most of us don’t have the fortune to own many types of makeup and just stick to one variation. But ideally, makeup should change according to what you wear and what occasion you are in. Have 2 or 3 extra colors of Cheek in your makeup arsenal, and choose it to match with your outfit of the day – if you’re wearing a light yellow colored shirt, try putting on the cheek with a hint of yellow. You’d be surprised how it fits together so well!</p>
